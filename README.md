This is a bioinformatics based project which is done using the pattern matching techniques like edit distance(Leveinshtein distance) and hamming distance. It is already known that most of the diseases related to some of the genetic disorder which include down syndrone, cancer, covid virus and many. It is said that nearly 40% of diseases are related to the genetic disorders. <br />
  Conceptually, genetic disorders comes into play when some mutations in a particular gene occurs which could be due to external environment, physical activities, habits and many others so, it is very important to know about the changes in the gene that leads to various diseases. In general, mutations can be of two types point and frame shift mutations.
## 1. Point Mutations: 
As the name says that a point mutation is a type of mutation which is due to changes at a point in the gene. Substitution is one such type of mutation.  
### i. Substitution mutation: 
Mutations that are due to substitution of nucleotides i-e <br />
let, <br />
original gene = ATCGATGCTAGGCTGACCAGTCCAAAA <br />
Mutated gene = ATCG*C*TGCTAGGCTG*T*CCAGTCCAAAA <br />
In the above example the mutations occurs due to the replacement of nucleotides that are bolded <br />

## 2. Frameshift Mutations: 
As the name says that the frame shift mutations are the type of mutations such that if happens the whole frame of the gene will be shifted which results in change in the whole protein coding sequence which is as shown below

### i. Insertion mutation
let, <br />
original gene = ATCGATGCTAGGCTGACCAGTCCAAAA <br />
Mutated gene = ATCGAT**G**GCTAGGC**C**TGACCAGTCCAAAA<br />
In the above example the mutations occurs due to the addition of a new neucleotide in the sequence that are bolded which resulted in changing the length of the gene and the protein encodings. Like intitially GCT codes for proteinA then after mutation instead of GCT coding for proteinA GGC codes for proteinB and thsi continues to happen until the last codon<br />

### ii. Deletion mutation
let, <br />
original gene = ATCGATGCTAGGCTGA**C**CAGTCCAAAA <br />
Mutated gene  = ATCGATGCTAGGCTGACAGTCCAAAA<br />
In the above example the mutation happens due to the deletion of the bolded nucleotide due to which the length of the gene is decreased and the frame is shifted backwards and as a result the protein codings will change as the codon pair changes.

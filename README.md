This is a bioinformatics based project which is done using the pattern matching techniques like edit distance(Leveinshtein distance) and hamming distance. It is already known that most of the diseases related to some of the genetic disorder which include down syndrone, cancer, covid virus and many. It is said that nearly 40% of diseases are related to the genetic disorders. 
  Conceptually, genetic disorders comes into play when some mutations in a particular gene occurs which could be due to external environment, physical activities, habits and many others so, it is very important to know about the changes in the gene that leads to various diseases. In general, mutations can be of two types point and frame shift mutations.
## 1. Point Mutations: 
As the name says that a point mutation is a type of mutation which is due to changes at a point in the gene. Substitution is one such type of mutation.  
### i. Substitution mutation: 
Mutations that are due to substitution of nucleotides i-e
------------------------
let, 
original gene = ATCGATGCTAGGCTGACCAGTCCAAAA </b >
Mutated gene = ATCG*C*TGCTAGGCTG*T*CCAGTCCAAAA
In the above example the mutations occurs due to the replacement of nucleotides that are bolded

## 2. Frameshift Mutations: 
As the name says that the frame shift mutations are the type of mutations such that if happens the whole frame of the gene will be shifted which results in totally change in the
